Review a completed research dimension and identify gaps or areas needing additional research.

## Instructions

1. Read the research output file from `research/` for the specified dimension.
2. Read the original dimension spec from `agent_docs/`.
3. Check: Did the research answer ALL research questions listed in the spec?
4. Check: Are all sources actually verified (URLs work, claims match)?
5. Check: Is the "Recommendation for Matthew" specific enough to act on, or is it generic?
6. Check: Does the "Example Application" use his actual resume content?
7. Check: Are cross-references to other dimensions noted?
8. List gaps found and suggest targeted follow-up searches.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS should be a dimension number, e.g.: `/review D7`
