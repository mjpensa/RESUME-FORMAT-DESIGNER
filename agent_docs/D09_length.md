# D9: Resume Length & Page Strategy

**Priority:** 9th | **Depends on:** D1, D8

## Research Questions

1. Is 2 pages appropriate for 10-year background at VP/Senior Manager level? Evidence?
2. Page 1 vs. page 2 content allocation?
3. How to handle Citizens Bank (2013-2015) and TD Bank (2012-2013)?
4. Condense early roles to 1-2 lines, merge into "Early Career," or drop?
5. What goes "below the fold" (bottom of page 1 / top of page 2)?
6. The reference notes section at the bottom of the current resume document — confirm removal.

## Source Targets

- HBR (Lees on page length for senior professionals)
- Recruiter survey data on page preferences by career level
- Eye-tracking data on page 2 attention
