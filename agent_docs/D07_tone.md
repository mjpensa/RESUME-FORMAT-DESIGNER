# D7: Tone, Voice & Word Choice

**Priority:** 1st (foundational — governs word-level decisions across all other dimensions)

## Research Questions

1. What is the optimal tone for a senior financial services / risk management resume?
2. How to express confidence without arrogance at the sentence level?
3. Narrative vs. discrete impact statements — which reads better to hiring managers?
4. What filler words and phrases must be eliminated?
5. How do AI-generated resumes differ from human-written ones — what are the detectable tells?
6. What does "conversational but professional" look like in specific sentence examples?
7. How should tone shift between summary (positioning) and bullets (evidence)?
8. Should consulting project descriptions (scope lines) have a different tone than the bullets beneath them?
9. How to write about governance and framework work without sounding abstract or bureaucratic?
10. What makes a bullet "sound like a senior person" vs. "sound like a junior person describing senior work"?

- Sedona Staffing: sentence-level tone guidance

## Calibration Examples from Current Resume

Strong bullet (use as baseline):
> Developed a target operating model outlining over 50 capabilities and associated business requirements needed to monitor, detect, respond to, and recover from a data corruption event. Led cross-functional pods of 20 professionals to operationalize discrete capabilities through in-house development, vendor assessments, and leveraging existing functions

Weak bullet (diagnose the problems):
> Managed team responsible for conducting a review of the Bank's real-estate loan portfolio with the goal of documenting and remediating non-compliance with the NFIP's (National Flood Insurance Program) insurance coverage requirements

## Deliverable

Granular, sentence-level guidance. Not "be confident and use active voice." Specific sentence structures, clause patterns, word choices, and tonal markers that distinguish a senior governance professional's resume from a junior consultant describing senior work. Include do-this / not-this pairs.
