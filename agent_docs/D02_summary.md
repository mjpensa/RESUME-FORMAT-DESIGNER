# D2: Professional Summary / Headline

**Priority:** 3rd | **Depends on:** D7 (Tone), D3 (Bullets)

## Research Questions

1. Optimal length at VP/Senior Manager level?
2. Paragraph form or short statements?
3. What should the first 15-20 words contain? (Critical attention window)
4. How to structure for career evolution (regulatory consulting → AI governance)?
5. Keywords in summary vs. reserved for skills section?
6. What "virtual title" descriptor should lead? (e.g., "AI governance strategist with...")
7. Should the summary signal the career evolution explicitly, or just position the target identity?

## Source Targets

- HBR: "How to Write a Résumé That Stands Out" (Amy Gallo, citing John Lees and Jane Heifetz)
- Harvard Business School Alumni resume guidelines
- Toptal 2025 resume guide
- ResumeBuilder.com 2025 trends
- Senior executive resume guidance (VP/Director level, not C-suite)

## Current Summary (needs complete rewrite)

> Top-performing consultant with strong background in program management and process optimization. Skilled in driving strategic transformations focused on solving complex problems in support of risk management and operational improvement.

This is generic, says nothing about AI governance, and could describe any consultant.

## Deliverable

Summary structure template with fill-in guidance and a first-15-words formula. Apply D7 tone and D3 construction findings. The summary must simultaneously: (1) position for AI governance roles, (2) establish credibility through 10 years of FS regulatory consulting, (3) signal AI fluency without triggering engineering-role routing.
