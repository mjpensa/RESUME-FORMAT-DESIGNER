# D3: Bullet Point Construction — Formula & Style

**Priority:** 2nd | **Depends on:** D7 (Tone)

## Research Questions

1. Optimal formula for consulting/financial services bullet points?
2. Bullet count per role/engagement? Optimal length per bullet (word count, line count)?
3. Ratio of quantified vs. qualitative bullets?
4. CAR vs. STAR vs. Columbia Action-Result vs. Yale XYZ — which framework?
5. Structure for consulting engagements (project-based, not steady-state roles)?
6. One sentence or two per bullet?
7. How to handle bullets where the quantified result is client-proprietary (can't disclose)?
8. How to write governance/framework bullets where the "result" is a capability, not a metric?

## Source Targets

- Columbia University: "Resumes with Impact: Creating Strong Bullet Points"
- Yale OCS: "Writing Impactful Resume Bullets"
- University of Michigan-Dearborn STAR method
- Let's Eat Grandma: 4-step bullet point formula
- MBB consulting resume guides (IGotAnOffer, MyConsultingCoach, Leland, CaseBasix, StrategyCase)
- HBR on accomplishments vs. responsibilities (Jane Heifetz: "95% accomplishments")

## Calibration Examples from Current Resume

Framework/strategy:
> Developed a target operating model outlining over 50 capabilities and associated business requirements needed to monitor, detect, respond to, and recover from a data corruption event. Led cross-functional pods of 20 professionals to operationalize discrete capabilities through in-house development, vendor assessments, and leveraging existing functions

Governance/oversight:
> Designed a strategy and framework for reporting and governance functions to support the newly launched risk function, enabling robust oversight of individual business units by risk management, audit, and board committees

Process/operational:
> Drove operational redesign and change management across Bank's loan operations, risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit teams by designing and maintaining detailed process flows used for reviewing the validity of 1.2 million fraud claims

Quantified outcome:
> Achieved an 8% increase in market share of consumer lending products by leading a team of 4 consultants and the Bank's credit risk experts to propose and implement an overhauled rate pricing structure that was aligned with industry standards

Weak/generic:
> Managed team responsible for conducting a review of the Bank's real-estate loan portfolio with the goal of documenting and remediating non-compliance with the NFIP's insurance coverage requirements

## Deliverable

A bullet point formula with annotated examples applied to Matthew's actual engagements. Must address the governance-work quantification challenge specifically. Apply D7 tone findings.
