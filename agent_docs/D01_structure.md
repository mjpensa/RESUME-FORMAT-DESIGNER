# D1: Overall Structure & Section Order

**Priority:** 4th | **Depends on:** D7, D3, D2

## Research Questions

1. Optimal section order for senior professional (10+ years) targeting VP/Senior Manager?
2. Lead with Summary, Core Competencies, or jump to Experience?
3. Where should "AI Fluency" or "Technical Competencies" go — maximum impact without triggering engineering-role ATS routing?
4. Eye-tracking evidence on section attention and ordering?
5. Content distribution across pages for 2-page resume?
6. Single-column vs. hybrid layout?
7. For consulting backgrounds: firm-level entries with project sub-entries, or flat chronological?

## Source Targets

- TheLadders Eye-Tracking Studies (2012, 2018)
- Nielsen Norman Group F-pattern research
- Wonsulting Eye-Tracker Experiment (2025)
- Harvard Business School Alumni Career Services
- Columbia University career services
- Jobscan State of Job Search 2025
- MDPI: "Using ML with Eye-Tracking Data to Predict if a Recruiter Will Approve a Resume" (2023)

## Current Structure

1. Name / Contact
2. Summary (2 sentences, generic)
3. Core Competencies (single line of comma-separated terms)
4. Professional Experience (reverse-chron: EY → Capco → Citizens Bank → TD Bank, with bold sub-entries per consulting engagement under each firm)
5. Education
6. Certifications / Technical Skills

## Key Structural Questions

- Where does an "AI Fluency" section go? It's self-directed work that doesn't fit neatly into Professional Experience or Technical Skills.
- Should Core Competencies stay as a keyword line near the top?
- Are bold sub-headings per engagement (e.g., "Data Resiliency Risk Strategy Design: Wells Fargo OCC MRA Remediation") optimal for this target audience?
- Citizens Bank and TD Bank (branch management, 2012-2015) — structural handling?
