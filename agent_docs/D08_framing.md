# D8: Career Evolution Framing

**Priority:** 5th | **Depends on:** D7, D3, D2, D1

## Research Questions

1. How should the resume frame: banking operations → risk consulting → AI governance?
2. Where should AI prototyping appear: separate section, within summary, woven into recent role, or hybrid?
3. How do career transition resumes differ from chronological resumes in consulting/FS?
4. Precedent for "practitioner-who-pivots-to-governance" in other regulated domains (cyber → CISO governance, clinical → healthcare compliance)?
5. Should there be a "Selected AI & Technology Projects" section distinct from Professional Experience?
6. How to position self-directed prototyping as deliberate strategy, not hobby?
7. Risk calibration: too prominent → triggers engineering questions; too subtle → doesn't differentiate. Where is the line?

## Source Targets

- Career transition resume research
- Cybersecurity career path literature (technical → governance) as analogy
- HBR on career pivots and resume framing
- LinkedIn data on career transitions in FS risk → AI governance

## Core Tension

This is NOT a pivot — it's a natural evolution from regulatory remediation → regulatory transformation → AI governance. The resume must make this feel inevitable, not opportunistic.

The AI prototyping work is self-directed, not professional. It must be positioned as: "I built these to understand the risk surface I intend to govern" — deliberate strategy, not hobby.

The bridge between consulting work and AI governance is real but currently implicit. Examples:
- Wells Fargo data resiliency → AI model monitoring, drift detection
- RBC data lineage for CCAR → AI data governance under SR 11-7
- HSBC RCSA → AI risk assessment methodology
- MasterCard risk taxonomy → AI risk taxonomy design

Current bullets don't draw these connections. The framing strategy must determine whether to make them explicit.
