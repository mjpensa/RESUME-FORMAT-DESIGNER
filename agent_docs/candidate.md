## AI Differentiator

Deep self-taught AI fluency demonstrated through hands-on prototyping:
1. ISDA CDM RAG pipeline (semantic chunking, embeddings, hybrid search, knowledge graph)
2. Research-to-deliverable app (Gantt chart, branded PPTX/DOCX generation)
3. Autonomous web research agents with video transcription (Whisper)
4. Autonomous Power Automate agent (write access to Outlook, SharePoint, Azure — self-iterating deployment)
5. Resume conversion agent (template compliance, output consistency)

## Education

- BA Economics, SUNY Albany (not a target school — resume must compensate with impact and credibility)

- Professional Scrum Master 1 (Agile)

## Resume Readers (must perform for all four simultaneously)

1. **ATS systems** — primarily Workday (Fortune 500 banks), also Greenhouse, iCIMS. Parses text, matches keywords, ranks candidates.
2. **HR recruiters** — 7-second initial screen. Scanning for title match, company recognition, keyword alignment.
3. **Hiring managers** — in AI governance, model risk, AI advisory, or Chief AI/Data Office. Deep read if you pass screening. Domain experts who evaluate substance.
4. **Referral contacts** — receive resume directly, skip ATS. Need to quickly grasp value proposition to advocate internally.

## Strategic Narrative

This is NOT a career pivot — it is a natural evolution: regulatory remediation → regulatory transformation → AI governance. Strongest differentiator: rare combination of deep regulatory expertise AND hands-on experience building with the technology. Bridges SR 11-7 model risk management and NIST AI RMF. Translates between technical AI teams, business stakeholders, and regulators.

## MBB Format Tension — Resolution

MBB-style consulting resume guidelines (1-page, academic-focused) are designed for campus recruiting and junior hires. Matthew is a 10-year experienced hire. When MBB guidance conflicts with senior professional standards, **default to senior professional**. MBB sources are useful for: tone, verb quality, bullet rigor, "resume as consulting slide" principle. NOT authoritative for: length, section constraints, education emphasis.
